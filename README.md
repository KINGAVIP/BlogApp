Blog App Application using MERN Stack
\
->Steps followed by Me\
1.Use of React+Vite App Instead of React App \
2.Setup Chakra UI for the project\
3.Setup Server using Express, Node, Mongodb , Nodemon (Just Setting and installing the dependencies required)\
4.Design of basic components in react- Pages like Home Page, Navbar, Cards Page, Login Logout Pages and dark mode\
5.Starting with functionalities of Sign In and Out -> Created DB schema for user which stores username, email and password of the user\
6.API for Sign In and Out (User Authentication) done.\
7.Forwarding with the UI of the project => Stores user info in local storage and allow only signed in users to create / delete blogs\
8.Implemented CRUD operation API in the backend\
9.Created Pages for Create Post, View Post and delete Post with Modal component.\
10.Added CSS to beautify the web app\
\
Improvements to be made:-
\
1.Proper and different files for the server for User and Blog . (Implemented complete backend in one file will improve it)\
2.Git Commit- Pushed complete code in one commit only as it was kinda first full project and took a lot of time and mistakes that's why will try to make commit\
              for each task next time.\
3.Better Design for the UI\
